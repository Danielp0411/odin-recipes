    <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup water or chicken stock</li>
    <li>Â½ cup drippings from a roast chicken</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a medium bowl. Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of water into the flour and whisk until combined and thick, but not pasty.</li>
        <li>Stir flour mixture and remaining water (or stock) into a roasting pan with drippings from roast chicken; whisk to combine and turn heat to medium. Cook, stirring constantly, until gravy is thickened and bubbly, adding more water (or stock) if needed. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
